    <h2>Jordan Peterson | Clinical Psychologist</h2>
    <h3>“The purpose of life is to identify and follow a mode of being that makes life justifiable, even given the radical necessity of suffering.<br><br> If you are in a constant sate of placidity, satisfaction, and happiness, then nothing is going to affect you deeply enough - not your own suffering, not the suffering of other people, not injustice or the horrors of the world - so that you become deep. And life without depth is, by definition, shallow and meaningless. <br><br> And there's a problem that's associated with that... because life is tragic and because it involves suffering, if your philosophy is shallow and meaningul when you suffer, you'll become resentful, hostile, self-critical, and then you'll become cruel and destructive. <br><br> So not only is there a necessity for your own mental health to fortrightly confront the deep questions of life. But if you don't, then you remain a danger to yourself and, more importantly, to others.”</h3>

    <h2>Manuel Goes To Paradise</h2>
    <h3>For a while, Manuel enjoys the freedom of retirement, not having to get up at a particular
        time, and being able to use his time to do what he wants. However, he soon falls into
        depression. He feels useless, excluded from the society he helped to build, abandoned by his
        grown-up children, incapable of understanding the meaning of life, having never bothered to
        answer the old, old question: ‘What am I doing here?’<br><br>
        Well, our dear, honest, dedicated Manuel finally dies – something that will happen to all
        the Manuels, Paulos, Marias, and Mônicas of this world. And here, I will let Henry
        Drummond, in his brilliant book, The Greatest Thing in the World, describe what happens
        next:<br><br>
        Since earliest times people have asked the great question: What is the supreme good?
        You have life before you. You can only live it once. What is the noblest object of desire,
        the supreme gift to covet?<br><br>
        We have been accustomed to be told that the greatest thing in the religious world is
        faith. That great word has been the keynote for centuries of the popular religion; and we
        have easily learned to look upon it as the greatest thing in the world. Well, we are wrong.
        If we have been told that, we may miss the mark. In the 13th chapter of 1 Corinthians,
        Paul takes us to Christianity at its source, and there we see, ‘The greatest of these is
        love.’<br><br>
        It is not an oversight. Paul was speaking of faith just a moment before. He says,
        ‘And if I have all faith, so that I can remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing. ’
        So far from forgetting, he deliberately contrasts them, ‘Now abideth faith, hope, love’,
        and without a moment’s hesitation the decision falls, ‘The greatest of these is love.’
        In this case, our Manuel is saved at the moment of his death because, despite never having
        given a meaning to his life, he was capable of loving, of providing for his family, and of doing
        his work in a dignified manner. Meanwhile, even though his life had a happy ending, his last
        days on earth were very complicated.<br><br>
        To use a phrase I heard Shimon Peres use at the World Economic Forum in Davos: ‘The
        optimist and the pessimist both die in the end, but each lives his life in a completely different
        way.’

    <h2>The Story of The Pencil</h2>
    <h3>A boy was watching his grandmother write a letter. At one point, he asked:<br><br>
        ‘Are you writing a story about what we’ve done? Is it a story about me?’<br><br>
        His grandmother stopped writing her letter and said to her grandson:
        ‘I am writing about you, actually, but more important than the words is the pencil I’m
        using. I hope you will be like this pencil when you grow up.’
        Intrigued, the boy looked at the pencil. It didn’t seem very special.<br><br>
        ‘But it’s just like any other pencil I’ve ever seen!’<br><br>
        ‘That depends on how you look at things. It has five qualities which, if you manage to
        hang on to them, will make you a person who is always at peace with the world.<br><br>
        ‘First quality: you are capable of great things, but you must never forget that there is a
        hand guiding your steps. We call that hand God, and He always guides us according to His
        will.<br><br>
        ‘Second quality: now and then, I have to stop writing and use a sharpener. That makes the
        pencil suffer a little, but afterwards, he’s much sharper. So you, too, must learn to bear certain
        pains and sorrows, because they will make you a better person.<br><br>
        ‘Third quality: the pencil always allows us to use an eraser to rub out any mistakes. This
        means that correcting something we did is not necessarily a bad thing; it helps to keep us on
        the road to justice.<br><br>
        ‘Fourth quality: what really matters in a pencil is not its wooden exterior, but the
        graphite inside. So always pay attention to what is happening inside you.<br><br>
        ‘Finally, the pencil’s fifth quality: it always leaves a mark. In just the same way, you
        should know that everything you do in life will leave a mark, so try to be conscious of that in
        your every action.’

      <h2>How One Thing Can Contain Everything</h2>
      <h3>A meeting in the house of a São Paulo-born painter based in New York. We are talking about
          angels, and about alchemy. At one point, I try to explain to the other guests the alchemical idea
          that each of us contains the whole universe and that we are, therefore, responsible for its
          wellbeing. I struggle to find the right words, but cannot come up with a good image that will
          explain my point of view. <br><br>
          The painter, who has been listening in silence, asks everyone to look out of the window
          of his studio.<br><br>
          ‘What can you see?’ he asks.<br><br>
          ‘Astreet in Greenwich Village,’ someone replies.<br><br>
          The painter sticks a piece of paper over the window so that the street can no longer be
          seen; then, with a penknife, he cuts a small square in the paper.<br><br>
          ‘And if someone were to look through there, what would he see?’<br><br>
          ‘The same street,’ comes the reply.<br><br>
          The painter cuts several squares in the paper.
          ‘Just as each of these holes contains within it the whole view of the same street, so each
          of us contains in our soul the same universe,’ he says.<br><br>
          And all of us applaud the lovely image he has found.

      <h3>“ 'You are not the master of your own house. There are spirits that dwell within you.' <br><br> Meaning, you have a will and you can exercise a certain amount of conscious control over your being but there are all sorts of things that occur within you that seem to be beyond you ability to control. <br><br>Your dream or impulses, for example. They are so foreign from you that you may think they're not even a part of you. But more subtly, what compeles you? Your interests. Well, where does that come from? You may be asking what is controlling those interests and your impulses? <br><br>Well, it's not random! It's driven by the phenomenon that are best considered by sub-personalities - and even that's not the best way to describe it. <br><br> You can't make yourself interested in something. Interest manifests itself and grips you. So there's a calling in you, towards what you're compelled by and what you're interested in - and sometimes, that might be very dark and sometimes not - but you're compelled forward by your interest. <br><br> So the idea that what moves you away from comfort is something that's beyond you, that you listen to and harken to, that's exactly right. <br><br> You might say, well I don't want to call that God. It doesn't matter what you call it, it still is. And if you don't listen to it... you will pay for it like you cannot possibly imagine.”

      <h3>“If you're starting from little, you starting with more possibilities. You always move from something unberable about the present to a better future. And if you don't have that, then you have nothing but threat and negative emotion. Because positive emotions are generated in the conception of the better future and then the evidence that you generate yourself that shows you're moving towards it.
